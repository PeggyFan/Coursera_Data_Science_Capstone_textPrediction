Welcome to the Data Science Capstone Project

Around the world, people are spending an increasing amount of time on their mobile devices for email, social networking, banking and a whole range of other activities. But typing on mobile devices can be a serious pain. SwiftKey, our corporate partner in this capstone, builds a smart keyboard that makes it easier for people to type on their mobile devices. One cornerstone of their smart keyboard is predictive text models. When someone types:

"I went to the..."

the keyboard presents three options for what the next word might be. For example, the three words might be gym, store, restaurant. In this capstone you will work on understanding and building predictive text models like those used by SwiftKey.

This project starts with the basics, analyzing a large corpus of text documents to discover the structure in the data and how words are put together. It involves cleaning and analyzing text data, then building and sampling from a predictive text model. Finally, I use the knowledge gained in data products to build a predictive text product.

This application is about the analysis of text data and natural language processing. This repository contains the codes for the three products built for this capstone project:  

1. An intermediate R markdown report that describes in plain language, plots, and code your exploratory analysis of the course data set. It can be found here: http://rpubs.com/Snowcreeks/41538

2. A Shiny app that takes as input a phrase (multiple words), one clicks submit, and it predicts the next word. The .R files for the shinyapp are included. Data files are available upon request.
It can be found here: https://peggyfan.shinyapps.io/textPredictionGT/

3. A 5 slide deck created with R presentations pitching your algorithm and app to your boss or investor.
